### Automobile Sales Forecasting Using Functional Data Analysis
***
Nowadays, the automobile industry is changing rapidly due to the introduction of new energy fuels and the development of modern technology. Since the automobile industry is fairly complicated, it is of vital importance to select pertinent features and consider the relationship between sales of vehicles at different locations when building forecasting models. Predicting sales of various models of vehicles is constructive to inventory optimization, supply chain management, and other managerial strategies. With those in mind, this research proposes functional data analysis (FDA) together with functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) functional regressor to analyze the trends and trajectories of sales data by considering them as curves. To forecast future sales, this research compares several models with different basis functions and sales history and proposes the optimal model for automobile sales data, which increases forecasting accuracy by at least 16% compared to existent methods. In addition, the proposed model is also suitable for forecasting sales data of diverse granularity and achieves an average SMAPE of 0.3 on different datasets.
